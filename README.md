## Project Description

This project consists of implementations of Java classes to solve exercises. The developed classes are `Fatura` , `Empregado`, and `Data`, with test classes `FaturaTest`, `EmpregadoTest`, and `DataTest`, each addressing language concepts.

## Requirements

1. Exercise 1
    - Implement a `Fatura` class for a computer supply store.
    - The class should contain four variables: number (String), description (String), quantity purchased of an item (int), and price per item (double).
    - Implement a constructor and get and set methods for each instance variable.
    - Provide a method called `getTotalFatura` that calculates the value of the invoice and returns the result as a double.
    - Set the total invoice value to 0 if it is not positive.
    - Set the price per item to 0.0 if it is not positive.

2. Exercise 2
    - Implement an `Empregado` class that includes three instance variables: name (String), last name (String), and monthly salary (double).
    - The class should have a constructor and get and set methods for each instance variable.
    - Write a test application called `EmpregadoTeste` that creates two `Empregado` objects and displays the annual salary of each object.
    - Increase the annual salary of each `Empregado` by 10%.

3. Exercise 3
    - Implement a `Data` class that includes three instance variables: month (int), day (int), and year (int).
    - The class should have get and set methods for each instance variable.
    - The constructor should initialize the variables assuming that the provided values are correct.
    - Provide a `displayDate` method that displays the formatted date (day/month/year).

## Features

1. Exercise 1
    - Calculate the total invoice value based on the quantity purchased and the price per item.

2. Exercise 2
    - Store information about name, last name, and monthly salary of an employee.
    - Calculate and display the annual salary of an employee.
    - Increase the annual salary of an employee by 10%.

3. Exercise 3
    - Store information about day, month, and year.
    - Display the formatted date with slashes ( / ).
